Part 1: My Role
William Bouwman - Technical Artist

In my group I am a technical artist focusing on making technically sound models, textures, and animations to put in our game’s environment. It's important that the models I make are very clean in terms of UVs and textures so they are easy to work with on the programming side. The complexity of these models shouldnt impact the performance of the game so using the design patterns and plugins learned in this class to have the models I create to take up as little memory as possible but still look good. 

Week 1 Explanation:

In week one We learned how to import .fbx files from an open source website into our unity projects. We applied physics to the player and other game objects by adding a capsule collider and a rigid body so the player can interact with the obstacles in the game. Using Unity's input action system we applied movement and a jump action to the character. We added a walk animation and an idle animation using Unity’s animator. 

Week 2 Explanation:

	In week two we learned. How to make coins that are destroyed when colliding with the character. A points system for the coins that prints to the console. Added the ability to shoot bullet projectiles that are affected by physics. And added edit mode to easily change the game scene
